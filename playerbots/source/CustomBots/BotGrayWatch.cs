// BotGrayWatch.cs — somebody is fair game, somebody goes after them.
//
// A criminal is fair game and always was. Killing one is not a crime, it
// costs no karma and it earns no murder count, which is exactly why the
// bank steps used to empty every time a thief got caught. The bots knew
// none of that: every enemy scan in the shard begins "is this a
// BaseCreature with negative karma", so a gray could stand in the middle
// of the crowd and nobody so much as turned around.
//
// This watches for the gray flag on anything player-shaped — a bot or you
// — and hands the nearest few bots a reason to draw.
//
// REDS use the same machinery, for the same reason: killing a murderer is
// no crime either. It used to hand them straight to BotPKWatch, which does
// not fight — it yells for the guards. Where the guards turn out that is
// the whole of the answer and always was. Where they do not, it was the
// whole of the answer to nothing: a red could stand in a dungeon among a
// dozen blues and not one of them so much as faced him, because the only
// system that draws on a player-shaped target refused reds outright and
// the only system that handles reds was calling a watch that wasn't there.
// So a red counts as fair game wherever no guard will come, which is the
// same rule the players used — you jumped reds underground, you left them
// to the watch in town, and you left them alone in Buccaneer's Den.
//
// Nothing here sweeps the world looking for anybody. The gray flag
// announces itself three ways, all of them cheap: the engine's
// AggressiveAction event fires on every harmful act and says whether it
// was criminal; PlayerBot.CriminalAction reports a bot that flagged some
// other way; and the handful of actually-connected clients are checked
// outright, which catches you picking a pocket rather than a fight. The
// reds come in from the one sweep that already existed, BotPKWatch's,
// which walks the world every fifteen seconds regardless and now says so
// when it finds one with somebody standing next to it. Everything after
// that is a spatial query around a known target.
//
//   WHO      Fighting classes only. A smith at his forge, a merchant, a
//            tailor: not their business. Willingness is rolled off the
//            bot's serial so the same bot is the same kind of person
//            every time, nudged by Brave and Cautious.
//   HOW MANY Three at once. A gray gets jumped, not mobbed by a town.
//   WHERE    Bots whose behavior already knows how to fight get handed
//            the target and chase it down — their own tick swaps them to
//            a defender, the way being attacked mid-trip does. The
//            standing-around roles (bank crowd, shopkeepers) only take a
//            swing at arm's length, because a smith who abandons his
//            forge to chase somebody across Britain never comes back.
//   UNTIL    The flag lapses. Two minutes after the crime the target is
//            blue again, and a bot still swinging then becomes the
//            criminal — and would be jumped by this very system in turn.
//            So it is guarded from both ends: nobody starts on a flag
//            that is already running out, and every fight is called off
//            within a second of the flag dropping. Which is also what the
//            players who knew what they were doing did.
