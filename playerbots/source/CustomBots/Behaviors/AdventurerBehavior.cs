// =========================================================================
// AdventurerBehavior.cs — Bots that explore the wilderness/dungeons,
// engaging monsters they encounter. Uses PathFollower (A*) for real
// pathfinding so they navigate around obstacles, into dungeons, etc.
//
// Architecture:
//   Decision tick (2s):
//     - In combat? Engage / chase / retreat
//     - Look for enemies in sight; engage
//     - Otherwise pick a patrol point and pathfind to it
//     - Random pauses, stuck recovery
//
//   Step timer (400ms walk / 200ms run):
//     - Calls PathFollower.Follow — A* handles everything
//
// Patrol point selection:
//   Random point within WanderRadius of Home. PathFollower routes around
//   any obstacles. If unreachable (stuck > timeout), pick another.
//
// Permadeath: PlayerBot's death drops corpse; spawner replaces the bot.
