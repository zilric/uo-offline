// BotLifecycleManager.cs — Global tick that gives every bot a "life":
// periodically transitions them between behaviors (Banker, Adventurer,
// Traveler, etc) based on their personality.
//
// Tick rate: 60 seconds. Each tick:
//   1. Snapshot all PlayerBots (defensive against mid-loop mutations).
//   2. For each bot:
//      - If no personality yet, assign one and stamp PhaseStartedAt to now.
//        First-seen bots get a fresh phase clock — they won't immediately
//        transition. They serve their full initial phase first.
//      - If their phase duration has elapsed, transition them: pick a new
//        behavior weighted by personality, then place them appropriately.
//   3. Stagger transitions: limit how many bots can transition per tick
//      so we never get a cascade where 100 bots all teleport at once.
//
// Toggle with [SetLifecycle true/false. Off by default in case anything
// goes sideways on first deploy.
