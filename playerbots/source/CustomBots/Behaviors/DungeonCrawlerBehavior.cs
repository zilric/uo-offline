// =========================================================================
// DungeonCrawlerBehavior.cs — a bot crawling a dungeon.
//
// It subclasses AdventurerBehavior to inherit ALL the working combat and
// navigation (enemy acquisition, melee/ranged/spell combat, flee/retreat,
// stuck recovery, pathfinding). The crawler adds only what's dungeon-
// specific, exactly as the design intends ("build the crawl loop on
// working nav + crude fighting"):
//
//   - Goal selection is scoped to the points on ITS walkable floor
//     (SelectPatrolGoal → DungeonRegistry.RollPoint). Skill-weighted
//     descent makes depth emerge: low-tier bots stay shallow, high-tier
//     bots go deep. The bot is dumb and local; depth is not planned.
//   - Travel BETWEEN points rides the waypoint graph: a rolled target is
//     reached via graph hops, each short enough for PathFollower's A*
//     (38-tile search box). Without this, most points on a floor are
//     simply unreachable and the bot mills around one room forever.
//   - ROOM CLEARING: on reaching a room the crawler lingers a while,
//     fighting whatever's there (combat always preempts patrol). When
//     the linger expires and no more monsters are on it, it moves on —
//     preferring rooms it hasn't cleared yet, so it sweeps the floor.
//   - CAMPERS: a small minority (~15%) settle at the first room they
//     reach and farm the respawns there for their whole run instead of
//     sweeping. Everyone still leaves when the run timer expires.
//   - A Descend/Ascend point sits ON a real in-game Teleporter item,
//     exactly like a dungeon entrance: on reaching one, the crawler walks
//     straight onto the pad and the GAME teleports it (Teleporter.
//     OnMoveOver). The landing spot decides what happened — near a known
//     interior point → same crawler re-scoped to that level; nowhere near
//     one → the surface, revert to a Traveler.
//   - A run timer flips the crawler into EXIT MODE: it then seeks THIS
//     level's up-teleporter, climbs one floor, repeats — a per-level reflex
//     with no whole-journey awareness. The full climb-out emerges from it.
//
// LOOP-BREAKER: a crawler stays a crawler the entire time it's inside,
// including the climb out. It never runs the "entered a dungeon → become a
// crawler" entry handoff (only Travelers do), so walking back through a
// landing/entry area never re-grabs it. De-conversion to Traveler happens
// only on the surface (ResolveLanding, no interior point near the landing).
