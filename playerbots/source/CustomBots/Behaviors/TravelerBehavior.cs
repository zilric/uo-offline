// =========================================================================
// TravelerBehavior.cs — Bots that traverse Britannia using a waypoint graph.
//
// Architecture:
//   - Bot has a final destination (a node name from the WaypointGraph)
//   - On spawn (or after arrival), bot finds the nearest waypoint to its
//     current location, then runs Dijkstra in the graph to get a path
//     of waypoint names from there to the destination
//   - Bot walks each leg with PathFollower. Each leg is ≤38 tiles so A*
//     succeeds.
//   - On reaching the next waypoint, advances to the leg after it.
//   - Stuck recovery: if a leg fails repeatedly, recompute from current
//     location. If recompute also fails, pick a new destination.
//
// Step timer: same pattern as Adventurer — fires every WalkFootDelay,
// calls PathFollower.Follow() once per fire.
