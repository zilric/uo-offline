// RedTerritory.cs — places the honest bots stay out of.
//
// Buccaneer's Den is the pirate town. In the era it was where murderers
// went because the guards weren't looking, and a blue who wandered in got
// killed for it. Ordinary bots treating it as just another stop on the
// rota was both wrong for the setting and, on this shard, actively broken.
//
// It is an island, and the waypoint graph knows it: from the moongate
// there, a bot can reach 27 of 4013 waypoints and 9 of 480 destinations on
// foot. So a blue who gated in rolled a destination it could not walk to,
// gave up, walked back to the gate and left again. With a gate hop landing
// there roughly one time in eight, the moongate grew a permanent crowd of
// bots arriving, standing about and leaving.
//
// Reds are unaffected: PKBehavior reads DestinationCatalog.All directly
// rather than going through the weighted roll, so it keeps the run of the
// place, which is the point.
