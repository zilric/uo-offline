// =========================================================================
// BotBuyOffer.cs — you shout WTS at the bank and somebody actually comes.
//
// BotShopDeal runs a bot buying from a bot. BotShopTalk runs a player
// buying from a bot. This is the corner that was missing: a REAL PLAYER
// selling, with a bot on the buying end.
//
//   you: WTS GM halberd 5k
//   Ulric: whats the halberd, ill have a look          [starts walking]
//   Ulric: 2800?                                       [arrives, offers]
//   you: 4k
//   Ulric: 3400 is my max
//   you: ok
//   Ulric: drop it on me
//   [drag the halberd onto Ulric -> the trade window opens with his gold
//    already on his side]
//
// The shape is deliberately the same as the buy side, because it is the
// same market seen from the other chair:
//
//   the shout      BotAppraisal.BandForNoun reads the words and says what
//                  that kind of thing trades for. No band, no interest.
//   the walk       PathFollower across the bank floor, on a timeout. The
//                  crossing IS the feature; a bot that teleports to you or
//                  answers from thirty tiles away reads as furniture.
//   the haggle     the bot's ceiling is real and hidden, it counters, and
//                  it will walk. It never pays more than its purse holds.
//   the payoff     BotTradeWindow, the same real trade window, with the
//                  sides swapped.
//
// Not every shout finds a buyer, and that is the point. Two gates have to
// open before anyone crosses the floor — what the room wants (rolled once
// per seller and per kind of goods, then REMEMBERED, so shouting the same
// thing again for the next quarter hour does not change anyone's mind) and
// what the individual bot wants (a mage buys reagents, a fencer buys
// weapons, a merchant buys anything). Some things simply do not sell.
//
// The one thing this has that the buy side does not: the bot agrees a
// price for goods it has never seen. So the number is re-checked against
// the actual item when it lands on the table (BotTradeWindow calls
// Balks), and a bot that agreed 3k for a GM halberd will not hand it over
// for a rusty dagger. That check is the whole anti-bait-and-switch story.
//
// There are two ways in. This file handles a player's WTS shout; BotWantAd
// handles the mirror, where the BOT shouted WTB and the player answers "i
// have one". Both land in the same state machine from the walk onward.
//
// Test hook: [BotBuy (GameMaster) fakes the shout from where you stand.
