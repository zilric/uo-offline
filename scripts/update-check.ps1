# update-check.ps1 - "is there a newer UO Offline?" check, run at launch.
#
# start.ps1 calls this before it starts anything. The rules it follows:
#
#   - No internet, GitHub down, rate-limited, anything at all goes wrong:
#     say nothing and let the game start. A failed check must never cost
#     the player their session.
#   - Already up to date: say nothing. No popup, no splash, no "you are on
#     the latest version" box.
#   - Behind: show one dialog listing what the update actually contains,
#     and let the player choose. Declining is remembered per version, so
#     the same update never nags twice.
#
# It writes exactly one line to stdout, which start.ps1 reads:
#   continue  - carry on and launch the game
#   updating  - the installer was started; do not launch the game
#
# Anything else this prints goes to stderr or nowhere, so start.ps1's
# parse stays simple.
