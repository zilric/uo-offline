# update-check.sh - "is there a newer UO Offline?" check, run at launch.
#
# The Linux/Steam Deck counterpart to update-check.ps1. Same three rules:
#
#   - No internet, GitHub down, rate limited, anything at all goes wrong:
#     say nothing and let the game start. A failed check must never cost
#     the player their session.
#   - Already up to date: say nothing. No output, no prompt.
#   - Behind: show what the update contains and let the player choose.
#     Declining is remembered per version, so it never nags twice.
#
# Exit codes, which start.sh reads:
#   0   carry on and launch the game
#   10  the installer was started; do not launch the game
#
# Asking the player is the awkward part on Linux. The desktop entry runs
# with Terminal=false, so a read prompt would be invisible and the game
# would just appear to hang. So we ask through whatever is actually there,
# in order: kdialog (Steam Deck's KDE), zenity (GNOME and friends), then a
# plain terminal prompt, and if none of those exist we stay silent and
# launch - never block on a prompt nobody can see.

# This used to be assembled from commit messages through the compare API,
# with a python3 path and a sed fallback for machines without it. It worked,
# and it read like a developer talking to another developer, because that is
# what commit messages are. Someone opening the launcher wants to know what
# is different in the GAME. A file in the repo says that better, and it
# deletes the whole JSON-scraping fallback along with it.
#
# Same failure rule as the rest of this script: if the fetch fails, show a
# generic line rather than dropping the check.
